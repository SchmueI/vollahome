# About
This project was initially created during the volla hackathon 2023.<br>
Volla is a phone brand based in Germany, creating an open and free operating system for their own sustainable Android device called Volla Phone. You can find them in the web: https://www.volla.online/<br>
Once a year a community of hackers and enthusiasts are gathering to develop ideas and programs during a hackathon hosted by Hallo Welt Systeme, the manufacturer of Volla Devices.

Capyloon is a project to bring back the Firefox OS base to modern devices.

Since the idea of a free and clean operating system like Volla OS matches perfectly with the puristic UX of Capyloon, Vollahome aims to combine the look and feel of Volla with the Capyloon base.<br>
Vollahome is a winner of the hackathon 2023. You can get an impression of the presentation at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAc3fA1edW4&t=17725s" target="_BLANK">stream recording of the Volla Community days on Youtube.</a>
